      <li>A letter (maximum 1 page) from your advisor (or faculty contact) confirming your good standing at the institution, explaining the benefits and potential contributions of your attendance at AFT, describing your current funding status and need for the travel grant, and committing to supplement the travel award to cover remaining costs.</li>
