# Workshop on Scalability & Interoperability of Blockchains (SIB)

SIB is a workshop on the scalability and interoperability of blockchains.

SIB aims to unite theoretical and practical approaches to the scalability and interoperability of blockchains, bringing together researchers and practitioners from the fields of security, cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and policy-making.

Scalability pertains to effectively maintaining a blockchain's throughput and latency as the network grows. Interoperability expresses the composition of multiple blockchains to build protocols with richer functionality on top.

The goal of SIB is to discuss state-of-the-art scalability and interoperability solutions, the advantages of each, and their respective converses.

The conference is co-organized with [AFT 2024](https://aftconf.github.io/aft24/index.html).

Call for papers[:](https://www.sbc-conference.com/#cfp)   submission deadline 10th of July.

Conference Date: 26 September 2024.

Venue: Austrian National Bank (OeNB), Vienna, Austria.

Registration: €100 for workshop only. €50 extra if you are already attending AFT. Plus €50 for late registration. Please [visit the AFT website](https://aftconf.github.io/aft24/index.html) to register.

##### **Topics of Interest**

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:


###### **Scalability**



* Rollups in the optimistic, ZK, and hybrid settings
* Any other scaling solution such as sidechains, payment/state channel networks (lightning etc.), sharding
* Modeling/proofs of security and/or attacks against existing scaling solutions
* Engineering considerations for the scaling of popular blockchains e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum
* Incentives of scaling, use of algorithmic game theory, and classical game theory techniques to prove security in rational/cryptographic models
* Blob / danksharding and other on-chain data storage techniques
* Off-chain data availability for scaling applications (e.g., EigenDA)
* Light clients
* Advances in consensus protocols that improve transaction latency and throughput
* All techniques to improve computation, communication, and storage complexity of validators and clients
* Scalability improvements in data structures such as execution-layer commitment data structures (Merkle trees, vector commitments, etc.)
* Programming language and compiler innovations (e.g. JIT) allowing for practical improvements in the execution of EVM, CosmWasm, and other popular platforms
* Applications of re-staking to scalability


###### **Interoperability**



* Connecting existing blockchains
* Authentication of messages between different blockchains
* Trustless blockchain communication
* Purpose-tailored interoperability constructions such as HTLCs, atomic swaps, etc.
* Generic message passing
* Hub-and-spoke architectures for interoperability
* Performance considerations of interoperability
* Practical engineering challenges in interoperability
* Empirical measurements for the performance and security of interoperable protocols
* Incentives, rationality and economic security of protocol for interoperability
* Use of optimistic and zero-knowledge techniques enhancing interoperability protocols
* Attacks on existing research and threat modeling of deployed protocols
* On-chain light clients / bridging

##### **Do Not Submit**

The conference is generally not intended for price analysis of cryptocurrency markets or other investor related topics. Nor is it a venue for legal considerations of owning or using cryptocurrency. We request proposals that are engineering or scientific in nature only.


---


##### **Submission Instructions**

Please submit a detailed technical paper that describes a novel contribution to the theory or practice of blockchain interoperability and scalability science and engineering.



* Please use Portable Document Format (.pdf).
* You must use the LIPIcs format (see [https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/LIPIcs](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/LIPIcs))
* Submissions are limited to twelve (12) pages, excluding appendices and references. Appendices and references are unlimited.
* Papers must be anonymized by omitting the author names in the pdf. Author names will be recorded in HotCRP but not displayed to the reviewers.
* If you have any conflict of interest with a member of the program committee, please note it in the designated section of the HotCRP submission form.
* All submissions may be automatically checked for conformance to these requirements. Failure to adhere to the page limit, formatting requirements, or anonymization are grounds for immediate rejection.
* Appendices will be read at the reviewers' discretion.

**Conflict of Interest**

Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years.
