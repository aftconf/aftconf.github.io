<h1 id="workshop-on-scalability--interoperability-of-blockchains-sib">Workshop on Scalability &amp; Interoperability of Blockchains (SIB)</h1>

<p>SIB is a workshop on the scalability and interoperability of blockchains.</p>

<p>SIB aims to unite theoretical and practical approaches to the scalability and interoperability of blockchains, bringing together researchers and practitioners from the fields of security, cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and policy-making.</p>

<p>Scalability pertains to effectively maintaining a blockchain’s throughput and latency as the network grows. Interoperability expresses the composition of multiple blockchains to build protocols with richer functionality on top.</p>

<p>The goal of SIB is to discuss state-of-the-art scalability and interoperability solutions, the advantages of each, and their respective converses.</p>

<p>The conference is co-organized with <a href="https://aftconf.github.io/aft24/index.html">AFT 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Call for papers<a href="https://www.sbc-conference.com/#cfp">:</a>   submission deadline 10th of July.</p>

<p>Conference Date: 26 September 2024.</p>

<p>Venue: Austrian National Bank (OeNB), Vienna, Austria.</p>

<p>Registration: €100 for workshop only. €50 extra if you are already attending AFT. Plus €50 for late registration. Please <a href="https://aftconf.github.io/aft24/index.html">visit the AFT website</a> to register.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-submit"><strong>Do Not Submit</strong></h5>

<p>The conference is generally not intended for price analysis of cryptocurrency markets or other investor related topics. Nor is it a venue for legal considerations of owning or using cryptocurrency. We request proposals that are engineering or scientific in nature only.</p>

<hr />

<h5 id="submission-instructions"><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></h5>

<p>Please submit a detailed technical paper that describes a novel contribution to the theory or practice of blockchain interoperability and scalability science and engineering.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please use Portable Document Format (.pdf).</li>
  <li>You must use the LIPIcs format (see <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/LIPIcs">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/LIPIcs</a>)</li>
  <li>Submissions are limited to twelve (12) pages, excluding appendices and references. Appendices and references are unlimited.</li>
  <li>Papers must be anonymized by omitting the author names in the pdf. Author names will be recorded in HotCRP but not displayed to the reviewers.</li>
  <li>If you have any conflict of interest with a member of the program committee, please note it in the designated section of the HotCRP submission form.</li>
  <li>All submissions may be automatically checked for conformance to these requirements. Failure to adhere to the page limit, formatting requirements, or anonymization are grounds for immediate rejection.</li>
  <li>Appendices will be read at the reviewers’ discretion.</li>
